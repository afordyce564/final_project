# if you want to make a new html page for new direction
  index.html is the template
  
#change function names and text in texts[] to reflect direction Frog is going in
ex. left side and right side -> leftSide(x) and rightSide(x)
  
     
# Direct to next page
  Go to the next() function
  
   location.assign("fourth_page.html"); <--- Change this to whatever page you want to go to next
